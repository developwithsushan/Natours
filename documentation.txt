Responsive Design Principles 
1. Fluid Layouts
 - To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)
 - use % (or vh / vw) instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout)
 - use max-width instead of width 

2. Responsive Units
  - use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
  - to make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

3. Flexible Images
- By default, images dont scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that
- always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property 

4. Media queries
 - to change css styles on certain viewpoint width (called breakpoints)


Layouts Types 
1. Float Layouts : The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float css property. Still used, but getting outdated.
2. Flexbox : Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for components layouts
3. CSS Grid : For laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid. Perfec for page layouts and complex components.
